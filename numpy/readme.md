# Introduction To NumPy

### What is Numpy?
* Stands for numerical Python
* Python package for scientific computing
* Provides support for large multi dimensional arrays and matrices
* Also provides a collection of mathematical functions to operate on those arrays efficiently
* Numpy is not just an essential tool for Data Analysis but also for machine learning as well

### Numpy key feature
1. **Efficient array computing**: At core of Numpy in the 'ndarray' object. ndarray is a dimensional array and it also provides vectorised arithmetic operations. In a regular python array made up of lists you would have to write a for loop but with ndarrays you don't have to do that
2. **Broadcasting**: NumpY supports broadcasting, it is  a powerful mechanism using which we can work with arrays of different shape while performing arithmetic operations. This approach is much faster compared to using Python for loops
3. **Mathematical functions**: Numpy provides a comprehensive set of mathematical functions to perform computations on arrays. These functions are also also optimised for performance
4. **Integration with other libraries:** Other libraries suc pas pandas, matplotlob, sci-py and scikit-learn are built on top of Numpy, they rely on numpy for numerical operations.
5. **Cross-platform and open source**: Numpy is available on all major operating systems.
