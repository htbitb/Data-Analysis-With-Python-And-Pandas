# Data-Analysis-With-Python-And-Pandas

## What is Data Analysis?
* Data Analysis is the process of examining, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
* Process involves series of steps which convert raw data into knowledge

## Steps in Data Analysis
* **Data Collection:** Gathering data from sources, which could include databases, surveys, etc.
* **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, duplicate records, or outliers.
* **Data Exploration:** Using statistical techniques and visualization tools to understand the basic properties of the data
* **Data Transformation:** Modifying data to facilitate analysis, which may involve normalizing data, creating new variables, or transforming variables to better reveal the underlying structures in the data
* **Data Modeling:** Applying mathematical models to the data in order to test hypotheses, make predictions, or uncover relationships between variables.
* **Interpretation and Communication:** Drawing conclusion from the analysis, and effectively communicating the results to stakeholders through reports, visualizations, or presentations. 

## Why is Data Analysis required?
* Informed Decision Making
* Identifying Trends and Patterns
* Improving Efficiency and Performance
* Problem Solving
* Innovation and Development
* Risk Management
* Enhancing Customer Experience
* Regulatory Compliance

# Data Analysis v/s Machine Learning v/s AI

## Data Analysis
* **Focus:** Data analysis involves examining, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. It's the process of digging into data to extract meaningful insights, such as trends, patterns, and relationships.
* **Methodologies:** It includes statistical analysis, visualization, data mining, and the initial steps of data preprocessing.
* **Application:** Business strategies, research conclusion, etc. It;s a more manual, hands-on approach to understanding data and typically requires human interpretation.

## Machine Learning
* **Focus**: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicity programmed to perform a task, these systems are trained using large amount of data and algorithms that enable them to learn how to perform the task.
* **Methodologies:** It includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Machine Learning models are trained on datasets to identify patterns and make predictions or decision based on new data
* **Application**: Machine Learning is used for predictive analystics, speech recognition, image recognition, and many other tasks that require the interpretation of complex data sets. It automates the extraction of insights from data.

## Artificial Intelligence
* **Focus**: AI is a broader concept that refers to machines or systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, learning, perception, and natural language understanding.
* **Methodologies**: AI encompasses machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and more. It involves creating algorithms that enable machines to mimic human cognitive functions
* **Application:** AI applications range from virtual assistants and chatbots to autonomous vahicles and sophisticated decision-making systems. AI aims to create systems that can operate intelligently and independently

# Summary
Data analysis is a foundational process for understanding data, machine learning is a method for computers to learn from data, ans AI is the broader discipline that aims to create system capable of intelligent behaviour, with machine learning serving as a crucial component in achieving that intelligence
